# Strivers A2Z DSA Services 

Welcome to my **Strivers A2Z DSA Solutions** repository! This repo contains my solutions to various data structure and algorithm (DSA) problems, following the structured curriculum from Striver’s A2Z DSA series. It covers everything from basic to advanced concepts, providing a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to master DSA.

## About the Project
This repository serves as my personal journey through the **Strivers A2Z DSA** series. The goal is to systematically solve problems in various topics, ranging from arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues to advanced topics like dynamic programming and graphs. Each problem includes my solution, code, and sometimes an explanation or analysis of the approach.


### Why I’m Doing This
- **Strengthening DSA knowledge**: It's essential for interviews and problem-solving.
- **Improving coding skills**: This structured approach helps me tackle problems from different levels of complexity.
- **Sharing with others**: By making this public, I hope it helps others who are following the same curriculum.

## What You'll Find Here
This repo contains:
- **Problem Solutions**: Organized by topics and categories.
- **Code Files**: Well-structured and easy to follow, each solution is written in clear, maintainable code (Java).
- **Explanations**: For more complex problems, I’ve added explanations or notes on the approach I used.

## How to Navigate
Each topic is organized into folders, and each folder contains the problem statements and their solutions.

To view a specific solution:
1. Go to the folder of the topic (e.g., `Arrays`).
2. Open the problem's markdown file for the description.
3. Open the corresponding solution file for the code.
